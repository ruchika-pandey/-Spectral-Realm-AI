# -Spectral-Realm-AI
Spectral Realm AI: Deep Learning-Powered Conversational Intelligence for 2D Gaming. Developed Spectral Realm AI, an innovative conversational AI system designed to transform 2D gaming by enabling dynamic, context-aware, and emotionally responsive NPC interactions. 
Leveraging a hybrid BiLSTM-Conv1D model with Sentence-BERT embeddings, SR AI achieves 85-90% intent classification accuracy, built using Python, TensorFlow, and Pygame. This offline-capable system overcomes the limitations of static dialogue, fostering immersive, player-driven narratives for applications in RPGs, educational games, and mental health-focused gaming.
Key Contributions:
-->Designed and trained a deep learning model for real-time intent recognition and dialogue generation.
-->Implemented a modular Tkinter-based GUI for seamless user interaction and performance visualization.
-->Ensured scalability to game engines like Godot and Unity, with future potential for multilingual support and voice integration.
Skills: Project Management, Python (Programming Language), TensorFlow, Pygame, BERT (Language Model), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, Hugging Face Products, Graphical User Interface (GUI), Command Line Interface.
